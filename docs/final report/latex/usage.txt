Bipartition undirected graphs with Gurobi.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i , --input INPUT FILE DIRECTORY
                        Specify the input file directory for your graph. It MUST be a Matrix Market File (.mtx), and MUST NOT include any negative numbers in the adjacency matrix. Graph partitioner works both with a weighted adjacency matrix and an unweighted adjacency matrix.

  -r, --random          Provide this flag if you want to experiment with random Erdos-Renyi graphs. If you also provide -i argument,the program will first partition the graph in the input file, then partition the random graphs.

  -n, --number NUMBER OF RANDOM GRAPHS TO PARTITION (Default: 1)
                        Number of random graphs to partition. Need to be specified if -r is given.

  -s, --size SIZE OF THE NUMBER OF RANDOM GRAPHS TO PARTITION (Default: 10)
                        Size (number of vertices) of the random graphs. Need to be specified if -r is given.

  -d, --density DENSITY OF THE RANDOM GRAPHS TO PARTITION (Default: 0.1)
                        Density of the random graphs. Need to be specified if -r is given.

  -l, --log LOG FILE DIRECTORY
                        Provide a log file name to log Gurobi's optimization process.

  -w, --weighted        Provide this flag if you want your random graphs to be weighted. You don't need this flag for your input graph (-i).

  -p, --plot            Provide this flag if you want your graphs to be plotted.

  -pDir, --plotDir PLOTDIR (Default: The directory of the program.)
                        Provide a directory to store the plots. Needs -p flag

  --version             show program's version number and exit
